In this infrasctrucutre, we will use [SERVICE]() as a service. <br>
You can find client applications for:

# Explanation of the compose file:

## General information about the container
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
services:

```
</details><br>

The first `SERVICE` defines the name of the service. This is the equivalent as the hostname of the container inside the docker network.<br>
We are using the official image `SERVICE/SERVICE` from Docker Hub. With no tags, the service will always use the latest version of the image.<br>
We define a `container_name` so it's easier to manage containers on our host.<br>
Finally, we define the `restart` policy to `always` so the container will always restart if it stops or if the host reboots.<br>

## Volumes
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
[...]
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /path/to/your/config:/config
      - 
[...]
```
</details><br>

The two first volumes are used to synchronize the time of the container with the host. This is useful for logs and other time-related operations.<br>
Then, we define where we want to store the configuration files of the service. This folder will contain information about the users and how Jellyfin is configured.<br>

## Network
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
[...]
    networks:                #1
      - docker_net
    ports:
      - 
networks:
  docker_net:
    external:
      name: jellyfin_docker_net
```
</details>

For this part, will first look at `networks: #2`:
 -
<br>

Then, we ask the container to use the network `docker_net` with `networks: #1` and we expose the port `PORT` of the container to the host. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *At the end of the configuration, you will have to comment or remove the `ports` section as we don't want to expose any ports of the host (we will use a Reverse Proxy instead).*


# Run the container
To run the container, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Alternatively, you can specify the path to the compose file:
```bash
docker-compose -f /path/to/your/compose.yml up -d
```
You'll be able to access the web interface of SERVICE by going to `http://your-server-ip:PORT` or `http://your-domain-name:PORT`.
