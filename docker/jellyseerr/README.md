In this infrasctrucutre, we will use [SERVICE]() as a service. <br>
You can find client applications for:
- 



# Explanation of the compose file:

## General information about the container
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
---
services:
  jellyseerr:
    image: fallenbagel/jellyseerr
    container_name: jellyseerr
    restart: always

```
</details><br>

The first `jellyseerr` defines the name of the service. This is the equivalent as the hostname of the container inside the docker network.<br>
We are using the official image `fallenbagel/jellyseerr` from Docker Hub. With no tags, the service will always use the latest version of the image.<br>
We define a `container_name` so it's easier to manage containers on our host.<br>
Finally, we define the `restart` policy to `always` so the container will always restart if it stops or if the host reboots.<br>

## Volumes
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
[...]
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /path/to/your/config:/config
[...]
```
</details><br>

The two first volumes are used to synchronize the time of the container with the host. This is useful for logs and other time-related operations.<br>
Then, we define where we want to store the configuration files of the service. This folder will contain information about the users and how Jellyfin is configured.<br>


## Specific options

> üî¥ *There is no specific option for this service*

## Network
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```yml
[...]
    networks:                #1
      - docker_net
    ports:
      - 5055:5055

networks:
  docker_net:
    external:
      name: jellyfin_docker_net
```
</details>

Then, we ask the container to use the network `docker_net` with `networks: #1` and we expose the port `5055` of the container to the host.

- 5055:5055   is the default port for Jellyseer WebUI.
- 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *At the end of the configuration, you will have to comment or remove the `ports` section as we don't want to expose the WebGUI ports of the host.*

The part `networks: #2` is different from the [`Jellyfin` service](../jellyfin/compose.yml). We are using an external network called `jellyfin_docker_net`. This network is created in the `compose.yml` file of the `Jellyfin` service. This way, the `Jellyfin` service and the `Jellyseerr` service will be able to communicate with each other and also with all the other services in the same network.

# Run the container
To run the container, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Alternatively, you can specify the path to the compose file:
```bash
docker-compose -f /path/to/your/compose.yml up -d
```
You'll be able to access the web interface of SERVICE by going to `http://your-server-ip:5055` or `http://your-domain-name:5055`.
